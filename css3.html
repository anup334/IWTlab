<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) plays a vital role in web design because it defines how web pages look and feel, turning raw HTML into visually appealing and user-friendly experiences. By separating content from presentation, CSS allows developers to maintain cleaner code and apply consistent styling across multiple pages. It enables control over layout, typography, colors, spacing, and animations, making websites more engaging and easier to navigate. Importantly, CSS supports responsive design, ensuring that websites adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, from desktops to smartphones. This flexibility not only enhances accessibility but also improves usability, helping businesses and creators deliver polished, professional websites that leave a lasting impression on visitors.</p>
